# Population_of_the_World

The goal of this project is to find out around which year human specie might achieve the maximum world populaton's amount.

Banglash Thana, a disctrict of Dhaka, Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated areas in the world.
In 2001, due to statistics, lived there 178 241 people within the are of 1,2 sq km,
which gives the population density equal to 148 535 people per sq km.
I'll round it up to 200 000 people per sq km and take it as the limit of population density.

World's land area is 149 million sq km.
However I docked the area of Antarctida equal to 14 million sq km and
I got the hypothetical land area allowing to live of 135 million sq km.

Then I multiplied max population density (200 000 people per sq km) by 135 million sq km.
and I got the result 27 trillion people which is the number of hypothetical maximum world population.

I considered 27 trillion as 100%.
Then I made predictions on world's population to find out how the percentage (x_population / max_population) will change over time
and around which year those numbers will be achieved.

I've also made some simple predictions and its visualizations on how human population will increase over years.
